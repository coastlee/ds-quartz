## Character Creation

![Creation](https://dragonsmokearchipelago.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/character-creation-1.jpg)

Races and classes of all kinds exist within the frontier that is the Dragonsmoke Archipelago. Within the Dragonsmoke discord server, we permit most content officially released for Dungeons and Dragons 5e. This includes material from Critical Role via dndbeyond’s partnership with the podcast group (starring the Blood Hunter class, Gunslinger Fighter subclass, and several races) in addition to the Acquisitions Incorporated content provided through a similar dndbeyond partnership.

We allow character sheets from dndbeyond.com, dicecloud, and google sheets. The links for each of these are found at the bottom of this article. If you’re new, it might be worth starting with dndbeyond.com, as making a character on that platform is as painless as could be.

### Ability Scores

Take the standard array or the point buy system. The standard array is `15,14,13,12,10,8`. We don’t roll for stats here.

### Backgrounds

Please select an existing background. You may reach out to a DM to customize your background should you so desire.

### Feats

Along with picking your chosen backgrounds, you are also free to choose a feat. If your background comes with a feat already, you must switch it for one not on this list and you do not get 2 for a single background. The feat you choose CAN NOT be one on the following list:

> [!NOTE] - Banned Starter Feat List
> - Aberrant Dragonmark
> - Alert
> - Crossbow Expert
> - Dual Wielder
> - Elven Accuracy
> - Fey-Touched
> - Great Weapon Master
> - Gunner
> - Heavily Armored
> - Heavy Armor Master
> - Lucky
> - Magic Initiate
> - Medium Armor Master
> - Mental Acuity
> - Mobile
> - Moderately Armored
> - Polearm Master
> - Prodigy
> - Quarterstaff Practitioner
> - Resilient
> - Scholar of Lore
> - Sentinel
> - Shadow-touched
> - Sharpshooter
> - Shield Master
> - Skill Expert
> - Spell Sniper
> - Tough
> - War Caster


### Equipment

You may roll for gold to purchase equipment, but that roll must be contained within [#character-creation-bot-spam](https://discord.com/channels/733841578174447717/734167898444136638/808403426861908018) and it must be near the post of your character sheet. You can roll this in discord by running the `!r xd4*10 "Rolling for Starting Gold"` where `x` is the amount of gold offered by your starting class. You can find that in the [Player’s Handbook](). Reach out to a DM if you’re not sure how many d4’s you’re allowed to roll. 

Rolling for gold replaces the gear you gain from your class and background. You start with a clean slate. Or, you may simply select the starting equipment. Don’t forget to equip your gear, however!

### Homebrew Content

If you would like to use some kind of homebrew we have accepted a lot of homebrew which can be found [here](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/new-world---dragonsmoke-archipelago-mortambo/a/homebrew-article) . If you would like to submit more homebrew you may do so on the discord by posting a link to it in [#homebrew-submission]() and then the DM team will review it and approve or reject it.

## Posting your Character Sheet

Navigate to [#character-creation-bot-spam](https://discord.com/channels/733841578174447717/734167898444136638) and paste your new character in that channel utilizing the [!beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/builder#/) or [!dicecloud](https://andrew-zhu.com/dnd/dicecloudtools/autochar.html) or [!gsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ApmbXHTln99fPTUpanyQRTXNzXbQ8UBTt3Uq8xInQKw/edit#gid=359784640). Upon completion of the above steps, tag a DM to review you character sheet. Once approved by a DM, you will be assigned a Member role and gain access to the soloing and other channels. Now you’re free to solo, join an arena, or hop on an adventure with others.

## Gaining Hit Points at Level Up

You get max hit dice + CON modifier at first level. After first level, you can roll for hit points (hit die + CON mod) in a bot spam channel or take the rolling average. If you decide to roll (and risk disappointment), please use the following format for proper documentation: In [#character-log](https://discord.com/channels/733841578174447717/890326019419025419/890336758485630986): Type in the Following to Roll HP on Level Up. 

- !r 1d#+Con “Rolling HP For [Character Name], Level ##”
- Replace # with the Die used for Hp (D6, D8, D10, D12)
- Replace [Character Name] with your Character’s Name
- Replace ## with the Level you are rolling for
