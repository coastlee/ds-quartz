A collection of small uninhabited islands near [[Wildcross]]. Merchant ships often navigate the waters between [[Wildcross]] ferrying goods to and from . The journeys are usually peaceful, although occasionally pirates do harass ships that stray too far from the normal shipping lanes. The weather in the isles can be a tad unpredictable at times, and itâ€™s not unheard of for a ship to go missing every now and then. This is part of what drives the cost of goods between the two port cities and makes the route such a profitable one. Many merchant ships also act as passenger vessels, turning excess storage and crew space into bunks for adventurers looking for quick and cheap transport across the sea.
